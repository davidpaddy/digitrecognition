Handwriting to digit using the MNIST dataset

This is a project on the MNIST dataset, featuring a neural network with a three-layer architecture. It includes plots of training and validation loss, as well as accuracy metrics. Additionally, the repository showcases a practical application of the model: a digit recognition demonstration using an image of a handwritten digit that I uploaded, with the model's prediction for the same.
